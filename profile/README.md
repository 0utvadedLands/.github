# OutvadedLands
OutvadedLands is a **parody** Minecraft server that is more cool, fun and better than InvadedLands because it is. This idea was inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rljaBhpB-w) but because a6d didn't have enough money for the domain to host longer, he resorted into closing it down and so I took it.

> OutvadedLands is still in beta so don't expect anything until the IP is avaliable.
